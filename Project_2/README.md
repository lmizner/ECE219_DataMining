# Project 1: Data Representations and Clustering

In this project, we explore the concepts of feature extraction and clustering together. The project is split into 3 parts as described below:
- Part 1 - Clustering on Text Data
- Part 2 - Deep Learning and Clustering of Image Data
- Part 3 - Clustering using both Image and Text

The project consists of 3 code file, with each file addressing a separate part of the project. Project2_Part1.ipynb addresses Part 1 - Clustering on Text Data, Project2_Part2.ipynb addresses Part 2 - Deep Learning and Clustering of Image Data, and Project2_Part3.ipynb addresses Part 3 - Clustering using both Image and Text. Last, there is a report PDF which covers all disscusion related to all three coding files. To run code, specifically for Project2_Part2.ipynb, Google Colab was utilized for GPU usage. For all code files, data files were placed in the same folder.
