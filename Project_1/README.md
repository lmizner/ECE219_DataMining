# Project 1: End-to-End Pipeline to Classfiy News Articles

This project covers building an end-to-end pipeline to classify news article samples and utilizes the following machine learning components:
- Feature Extraction
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Application of Simple Classification Models
- Evaluation of the Pipeline
- Replacing Corpus-Level Featrues with Pretrained Features

The project consists of 1 code file, which addresses all 13 coding questions, 1 CSV data file containing news article samples, 4 text files for GLoVE embeddings, and 1 Report covering all discussion related to the coding solutions. To run code all files should be located in the same folder.
